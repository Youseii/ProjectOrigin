# ProjectAI

***** In Progress *****

This is a Personnal Google Home, named Origin.

<< Only programmed in Python >>

You need to install, some packets : 

    ( The programm turns on Windows, so all the library here is from Windows maybe works on linux but check this after the installation )

- Speech recongation ( pip install SpeechRecognition )
- pyttsx3            ( pip install pyttsx3 )
- pywhatkit          ( pip install pywhatkit )
- pyjokes            ( pip install pyjokes )
- pipwin             ( pip install pipwin )
- pyAudio            ( pipwin install pyaudio )

Origin works when we call his name, for example "origin play see you again" and origin play on youtube the song " see you again".

He has few option like :
- play ( for music on youtube )
- time ( give the time )
- google ( lauch google )
- go ( my personnal touch ^^ )
- joke ( make some not funny joke ) 
- find ( search what you want, and give a little description )
- stop ( stop the system )

This Project is finished yet, i have a lot of errors ( like confuse words, some crash when we didnt detect his name )
